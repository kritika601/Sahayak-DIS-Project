The purpose of our project is to address the lack of accessibility
and usability of current smartphone interfaces for the elderly
population. As individuals age, they may experience a decline in
cognitive abilities, making it challenging for them to navigate
complex smartphone interfaces. This results in a significant issue:
many seniors express a desire to use technology but feel hesitant
and intimidated by the complicated smartphone interfaces.
Consequently, they miss out on the numerous benefits that
smartphones offer, such as communication, entertainment, and
access to important services.
